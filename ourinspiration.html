<h1 style="text-align: center;font-size=20px; text-shadow: 4px 4px 8px #666;">OUR INSPIRATION:</h1>
<P>
The biggest issue in our context is, there are lot of sources even here in the cyber space that are expressing themselves in providing people with some language information, to enable somebody to communicate fluently but you even hardly find out where even to click (the link) to get you on a real lesson! For a matter of practical example, the Tholulwazi team has experienced making the research thoroughly at the internet and public libraries after paging dictionaries of African languages!
</P>
<P>
<li>Firstly example, we typed the words “Zulu to English dictionary” at Google search bar and went through. We began with using the one for Google. The word from Zulu language was typed as follows: “injabulo”, the word “happiness” appeared and the Google dictionary ended there. Then the word “kokujabula” was typed also, the word “excitement” appeared and the Google dictionary ended there. The first translation of “injabulo” is approximately 80% correct! And the second translation for kokujabula is 100% wrong, since the people who compiled it were obviously willing to enable people to understand the language and therefore communicate well with other races. Before we put the exemplary explanation of the above matter, we want to ensure that even a stupid somebody, any language is very simple to understand, as long as the person who lectures has studied both languages full-time and for satisfying period. We may also fully agree that, just teaching people to get a theme, it takes a gifted skill in addition of the recently two mentioned above requirements!
</li>
</P>
<p>
<li>“Injabulo” (from Zulu language) means “The happiness/ excitement/ other synonyms”. In a proper communication, this word is always found at the <u>titles</u> of the context or at the <u>very beginning</u> of sentences only. So as the words “The happiness” in English, you can find this format at <u>the title</u> and also at the <u>very beginning</u> of the sentence even though you can also find them anywhere in English sentences, but we have corresponded precisely our translation.

“Kokujabula” (from Zulu language) means “Of the happiness/ excitement/ other synonyms”. In a proper communication, the prefix “Koku-“refers specifically to any non-living thing without spelling its exact name (it may be avoiding calling or really forgotten its word) and the suffix “Jabula” specifically refers to the translation “be happy”. For this one we are going to make a quick simple example: Imagine we are talking about the sound system with avoiding to call its name, we can say “<u>lokhu</u> kokujabula” to precisely translate “<u>This thing</u> of being happy”. 
</li>
</p>
<p>
<li>In addition, just try to browse the following site: https://isizulu.net  and try to find some lesson for a proper communication. May be you can find it…The list of petition is endless for the language abuse (not Zulu only). You ending up asking yourself that who exactly compiled these abuses. At the public libraries it is the same story of misleading people who got love of developing themselves!

The main point is, in this site we will not focus merely at one language of South Africa (Zulu), but the languages of Africa in gradually adding one for lecture after another, when recently found the perfect tutor to deliver. Nowadays it’s a Zulu language which is provided by our co-founder of this network (Tholulwazi international). The additions can occur anytime from now onwards on OUR BLOG page, just frequently visit your favorite site to develop yourself with the free available information.

We want to enable everyone to be aware of what we talk about! In DSTV sports programs, most of us we used to watch a logo of Supersports which says, “Siyadlala” together with its translation right there on the logo which says “Let’s play”. In a straight form that can be given even by a primary school learner, only the word “Asidlale” which means “Let’s play”. The word “Siyadlala” precisely means “We are playing” . 

So, we humbly are thanking all those who gave people the misleading information since they are our inspiration to bring this network to action these times.
